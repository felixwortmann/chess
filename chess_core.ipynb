    "## Memoization\n",
    "Memoization is used to cache the results of the minimax function. This can greatly reduce calculation time which makes it possible to play with more depth. The basic concept is taken from [this](https://github.com/karlstroetmann/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/Python/3%20Games/Memoization.ipynb) notebook of Prof. Dr. Stroetmann. In there it is implemented like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def memoize(f):\n",
    "    Cache = {}\n",
    "    def f_memoized(*args):\n",
    "        if (f, args) in Cache:\n",
    "            return Cache[(f, args)]\n",
    "        result = f(*args)\n",
    "        Cache[(f, args)] = result\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    return f_memoized\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the function `memoize` takes a function and returns a function with the same functionality. The difference is, that all results of the returned function are being cached. If the function is called again with the same parameters, the result will be returned much faster because looking up the value from the cache dictionary is (almost) always faster than calculating it from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We adjusted the function a bit to make it a better fit for caching our minimax function. The first thing you notice if you cache minimax with alpha beta pruning is that you get almost no cache hits and therefore no performance improvement. This is because there are many possible combinations of game states, depth, alpha and beta. All of these would have to be inside the key and all of them would have to be exactly the same. This results in very inefficient caching. Because alpha beta pruning gives us a very big performance improvement, it is also not possible to just remove that. The solution we used is to just put the state of the board and the depht in the cache key. This results in much more cache hits. If you would just do that, the AI would sometimes do moves that are bad. This is the result of not including alpha and beta. What has to be done is checking if the current (not from the cache) alpha is bigger or equal to the alpha from the cache. It is very similar for beta: the beta from the cache has to be bigger or equal than the other beta. This ensures the correctness while still getting a very noticable performance benefit. As you can see above the `minimax()` function, we included `@memoize_minimax`. This always calls minimax with caching (using `memoize_minimax`) instead of the \"regular\" minimax."

    "## The Minimax function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following is the main *Minimax* algorithm implemented. To be technically precise, the used algorithm is called *Negamax* due to the fact that **both** players are maximizing while the Minimax algorithm has a maximizing (white) and a minimizing (black) player. This also means that the algorithm recursively calls itself but inverts the returned value. Apart from that, the Negamax algorithm is identical to the Minimax algorithm. Goal of the algorithm is to go recursively through the decision tree, finding the best possible move. To evaluate the moves and to decide how \"good\" they are, the function uses `static_eval` which can analyze the current board for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "![minimax image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Minimax.svg/400px-Minimax.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image above (taken from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Minimax.svg/400px-Minimax.svg.png) shows a simple overview of how the Minimax algorithm works. It analyzes for each possible state—a state being a specific board—the value for each player. As the function works recursively, it analyzes each next state until the maximum depth (in the `play_vs_ai` notebook the default depth is 5) is achieved. To prevent redundant computations, the function uses the above explained `memoize_minimax` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the function uses **Alpha-Beta-Pruning**. This means that the function checks, using the two values `alpha` and `beta`, whether a \"branch\" can be cut off. The image below (taken from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/AB_pruning.svg/1200px-AB_pruning.svg.png) visualizes this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/AB_pruning.svg/1200px-AB_pruning.svg.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown, some branches can be completely ignored because the enemy player will not play a move which would result in achieving the respective state. Together with the memoization, this improvement can result in lower computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input parameters for the function are as follows:\n",
    "- `board`, the current board\n",
    "- `depth`, the depth to which the board will be analyzed (decrements with each recursive call)\n",
    "- `alpha` and `beta`, needed for Alpha-Beta-Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses two global variables, `BEST_MOVE` and `MINIMAX_CALLS`. The first variable is the move to play which will be set only if the function is at the \"top\" of the decision tree i.e. when the `depth` is equal to the `ANAlYZING_DEPTH` (which is being set in the function `minimax_input`). The variable `MINIMAX_CALLS` is only needed for debugging/analysis purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function arrived at the \"bottom\" of the decision tree i.e. the `depth` is equal to 0, it returns the value calculated by `static_eval`. If the `depth` is still greater than 0, the function uses *game move ordering*. This means that the possible moves will be ordered **before** going through them recursively. This greatly improves the chance of Alpha-Beta-Pruning being successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the function goes through the ordered moves and calls itself with a different board (the new board having a move from the list). It saves the maximum value together with the best move—which will only be set if the depth is at its highest value as explained above—while applying the Alpha-Beta-Pruning, performing a `break` if the maximum value is bigger than `beta`."
